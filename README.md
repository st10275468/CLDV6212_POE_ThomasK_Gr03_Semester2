Project Name: ABC Retail Management system

Description: 
The Web application I have designed for ABC Retail is designed to help employees create customer profiles, upload product images and information, upload contracts and process orders.
I was asked to design this as they had troubles with their last management system. This is why I made everything simple but effective. I have used Azure storage services to make it even easier for the employees
to interact with the customer profiles and product related information.

Guide:
1. First ensure that you have Visual Studio 2022, .NET core SDK 8.0 and the Azure storage service add on's before going further.
2. Then you must clone the gihub repository from the link provide in the document submitted.
3. You will need to create your own storage accounts on Azure if you want it for personal use.
4. After you have created a storage account you will need to copy the storage account access key and put it in your appsettings.json file.
5. Build the project.
6. You can see your storage accounts being updated on Microsoft Azure.
